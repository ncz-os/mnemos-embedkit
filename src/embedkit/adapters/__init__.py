Adapters are imported lazily so a missing optional dependency on one
adapter (e.g. `mlx` not installed on a Linux box) does not break the
whole kit. Engine.auto() iterates the registry, calls is_available()
on each class, and picks the fastest among those that report True
within the highest-populated tier.
